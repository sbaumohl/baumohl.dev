# Sbaumohl Personal Website

This is my personal website I've ship-of-theseus'd into an [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) website. I try to keep the style simple and minimalist, focusing more on the content over the style of the site. The site uses [Source Serif 4](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4).

I originally built this using Gatsby and Bootstrap, which then became an Angular website, which then briefly became a NextJS website before I transitioned to Astro. Much of the git history has been annihilated simply because no one needs to see high-school-me's idea of what a good website looked like.
